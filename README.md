# Moore Machine #
**This C++ project reads a set of states, transitions, and input strings from an input file (input.txt). It simulates a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) based on the provided inputs. The program determines whether each input string is accepted by the DFA and outputs the result accordingly. Additionally, it provides information about the path followed by the DFA for each accepted input string.**

## Usage ##
- the input is read from "input.txt"
- build and run moore_machine.cpp
